          Bennett wrote: "[I] am heartbroken to announce the passing of Alan
          Lancaster, British born music royalty, guitar God and founding member
          of the iconic band, Status Quo,
        </p>
        <p>
          "Despite having MS and issues with his mobility, Alan participated in
          hugely successful reunion tours.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He bravely played to thousands of adoring fans.. and loved being back
          with the band and his loyal Quo army."
        </p>
        <p>Lancaster was born in Peckham, London, in 1949.</p>
        <p>
          He formed a band in 1962 with his then-schoolmate, Francis Rossi, who
          became the singer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with two other classmates, they formed a group known as
          Scorpions which was later renamed Status Quo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rossi and guitarist Rick Parfitt — who died in 2016 — launched their
          hit-making career with the release of Pictures of Matchstick Men.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, Lancaster performed with the group until 1985, appearing
          on 15 albums.
        </p>
        <p>
          Status Quo enjoyed more than 60 Top 40 hits in the UK and had 25 UK
          Top 10 albums.
        </p>
        <p>
          They released over 100 singles, including hit songs such as Down Down
          and Whatever You Want.

        <p>His last album with the band was 1983’s Back To Back.</p>
        <p>
          But his final performance as a full-time member of Status Quo was at
          Wembley Stadium in July 1985 for the opening of Live Aid
        </p>
        <p>
          In March 2013 he collaborated with his old bandmates for a series of
          "Frantic Four" concerts in Britain.
