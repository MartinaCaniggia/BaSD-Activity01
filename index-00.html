          >Meat processors are in talks with the government over a shortage of
          carbon dioxide that could hit meat production.</strong

      </p>
      <p>
        Poultry producers said the shortage "threatens national food security".
      </p>
      <p>
        The gas is used to stun pigs and chickens prior to slaughtering, and
        also in the packaging process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The carbon dioxide used by the meat industry is a by-product of
        fertiliser production, but fertiliser factories have been halting
        production due to soaring natural gas prices.
      </p>
      <p>The government said it was monitoring the situation "closely".</p>
      <p>
        It has been holding emergency talks with industry groups and meat
        processors,
        <strong>

      </p>
      <p>
        Fertiliser producers have been struggling with natural gas prices that
        are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from
        the Covid crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the UK, lower winds have meant less renewable energy is generated,
        there have been outages at some nuclear stations, and there have been
        lower flows into the UK of natural gas from Norway, pushing up the price
        of natural gas.
      </p>
      <p>
        This week, two large UK fertiliser factories owned by US firm CF
        Industries Holdings suspended operations due to soaring gas prices, and
        on Friday Norwegian firm Yara said it would also cut production at a
        number of its European plants.

        Nick Allen, the chief executive of the British Meat Processors
        Association (BMPA), attended emergency talks with the Department of the
        Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) on Friday to discuss the
        issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This crisis highlights the fact that the British food supply chain is
        at the mercy of a small number of major fertiliser producers - four or
        five companies - spread across northern Europe. We rely on a by-product
        from their production process to keep Britain's food chain moving," Mr
        Allen said.
      </p>
      <p>
        About 20 million birds per week are slaughtered, but abattoirs only hold
        a limited stock of carbon dioxide, British Poultry Council chief
        executive Richard Griffiths said
      </p>
      <p>
        "With fewer than 100 days to go until Christmas, and already facing
        mounting labour shortages, the last thing British poultry production
        needs is more pressure.
      </p>
      <p>
        "If CO2 supplies become tighter and more unpredictable then supply
        chains will have to slow down. Ultimately, no CO2 means no throughput."

          He said the industry group's members "are on a knife-edge situation at
          the moment".
        </p>

      <p>
        Meat processors are working with government to "mitigate any major
        impact on a sustainable supply of food", he added.
      </p>
      <p>
        "This is incredibly serious," one supermarket executive told the BBC.
        "Some suppliers are telling us they could run out of CO2 in less than
        two weeks."
      </p>
      <p>
        Industry groups and processors also had a meeting with the government on
        Thursday.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meat processors have already been struggling with a shortage of lorry
        drivers and recruitment problems at abattoirs exacerbated by EU
        nationals leaving the UK after Brexit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Gas uses</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Carbon dioxide is used when slaughtering pigs and chickens to stun them,
        and it is used during the packaging process for all meat to prolong
        shelf life.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is widely used throughout the food industry, including in brewing.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the closure of the two CF Industries plants has cut 60% of the
        UK's food-grade carbon dioxide supply, the BMPA spokesperson said.
      </p>
      <p>
        It unclear how much carbon dioxide abattoirs and other food factories
        have stored.
      </p>
      <p>
        The remaining UK carbon dioxide production is being prioritised for the
        NHS for medical uses, and for the nuclear industry, which uses it as a
        coolant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without carbon dioxide, the slaughtering process of pigs and chickens
        cannot go ahead, the spokesperson said.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cucumber Growers Association also warned of the effect of high
        natural gas prices on crops.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gas is used to heat greenhouses and provide carbon dioxide "which are
        both critical factors in growing and achieving the yields required to
        survive in the modern industry", it said in an open letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "extreme rise" in wholesale gas prices has piled costs on growers,
        it added.
      </p>
      <p>
        A government spokesperson said: "We are monitoring this situation
        closely and are in regular contact with the food and farming
        organisations and industry, to help them manage the current situation."
